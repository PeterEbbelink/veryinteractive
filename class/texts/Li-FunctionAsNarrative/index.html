            What is FUNCTION? FUNCTION is the projection of human needs on objects. FUNCTION is the mission of any product. FUNCTION is a prophecy: “A cage went in search of a bird.”<sup>1</sup> Objects that have FUNCTION indicate a possibility of something happening. FUNCTION leads to a potential story, and therefore FUNCTION is about narrative.

            I like to imagine that every man-made object is surrounded by a “magical circle”, just like the radiant circles within some Japanese Magical girl anime (fig.1). Imagine a stool silently unfolding its “magical circle”, urging people nearby to sit in it. Imagine also a chair, which unlike the stool, has a back to rest upon: its structure imposes the limit of space and direction on its “magical circle”. The chair decides the particular direction a person faces while sitting. Consider also long resting benches that are often found in galleries and museums: without backs or arms, they expand their magical realm in all 360 degrees, and therefore people can feast their eyes on art pieces set on the walls, floor, and ceiling… People can easily observe every corner by simply turning their bodies while sitting in the same place. (In a future project, I will change all the long resting benches in a museum into conference tables, or dining tables. I will name this project “Back to Art”.)
          </p><p>
            To research FUNCTION as narrative, I create products/objects myself. “Man-made products certainly change people’s lives” — this can be a designer or maker’s arrogant assumption. But it is very possible that “man-made products indicate potential changes, or tell pending stories.” To do this, I will explain two of my series that investigate FUNCTION.

          <h2>1. Container series</h2>
          <p>
            My first series is based on the notion of “container”. My favorite definition comes from a gospel tract: “Just as a glove is made in the image of a hand, so man is made in the image of God to contain God and express God.” A container is made in the image of another object in order to contain and express the object. An image of the content always exists in the empty center of a container, and that is why “container” is the first specific subject in my research. In comparison to making something without any clue or reference, making containers is easy because I can at least refer to something tangible and available in real life, as its content and reference. If an object narrates by its FUNCTION, a “container” narrates by quoting anoter object.

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            The first object I made is a container for medicine. I once saw my mother use a small case (fig.2) to organize her pills and capsules in order. This is a specially designed plastic box with seven sections marked Monday to Sunday for carrying tablets with her. I was touched by the ability to delicately categorize human needs into chemical compositions (calcium, vitamin and ferment, etc.). The container is also divided by weeks to show periods in which to take the pills. In this way, taking pills becomes a ritual, from which we get both physical and spiritual satisfaction. Then I decided to make a container to express this holy and accurate rite. The final product I completed is a container for a cold remedy named “ContacNT”. These capsules were split into four parts and separately fitted into different parts of the container. Orange and transparent “capes” are in two rows of holes set on this container, while pink and yellow powdered ingredients are loaded in two shallow grooves. This container can hold a whole pack of “ContacNT” capsules. Someone can encapsulate the drugs with a tiny steel spoon placed in front of it. I named this container “Help yourself” (fig.3). It makes the whole process of taking drugs to be even more fussy, delicate and ritualized. After I finished this piece, Chinese Government suddenly forbid selling this flu remedy “ContacNT” in mainland China because the police found that drug makers used “ContacNT” tablets as a key ingredient to produce methamphetamine. This adds a new layer to narration of this piece.

          <p>
            The second piece I made is a template. My inspiration is a “ring sizer” (fig.4), a template for people to determine his/her correct ring size. A “ring sizer”, a small piece of acrylic board with several cut-out holes, allows someone to figure out the size of his/her fingers, but it is not made for “holding” fingers like a typical container. A template is a very special kind of container that holds abstract data and scales instead of physical objects. I measured all the perimeters of body tips of a close female friend of mine, and made my piece “Cinderella” (fig.5). This template records the minimum sizes of circles that can just fit the different tips of her body parts: fingers, toes, nipples, tongue, nasal tip, eyelashes, etc. “Cinderella” is a template containing contradiction. Normally a template is a condensation of a common standard or predefined form. Instead, “Cinderella” documents very specific and private data from an individual woman’s body. It also can be seen as a physical infographic work.

            If FUNCTION does tell stories, then form and material are words and phrases for people to read. In the movie <i>Objectified</i> <sup>2</sup>, Alice Rawsthorn, design editor of International Herald Tribune, says, “‘Form follows FUNCTION’<sup>3</sup> has been annihilated by the microchip.” She gave a example: “We now have a new generation of products where the form bears absolutely no relation to the FUNCTION. Look at something like the iPhone and think of all the things it does.” In my opinion, this example can only illustrate evolution of FUNCTION, or evolution of human needs. Man-made products no longer function simply based on their physical appearance since we live in the era of the Internet. Products like the iPhone may not be as easily understandable and acceptable as a fork or a cup, but the relationship between FUNCTION and form never goes away. An obvious example is the iPhone’s screen, whose growing size allows people to watch larger sized videos or eBooks. The earphone hole and buttons on the iPhone also respond to certain FUNCTIONS. Specific forms of man-made products have become a learned symbol system, a language we can read.

          </div>
          <p>
            The finger hole (fig.6), a half circle cut in paper box, is a perfect example. Anytime we see a finger hole, we know it is the opening of a box, a place for us to use our hands and fingertips. I used this finger hole as form language in my third container. “To make up” (fig.7) is a container for a broken mirror. Compared with the first two containers, it cannot be duplicated at all. I took a folding mirror and the finger hole as my formal language. Finger holes, as tiny little words, hint that the mirror fragments can actually be taken out. If the fragments are taken out and put in sequence, that means that this cracked mirror can be restored to its previous state. “A broken mirror made whole again” is a Chinese idiom, and it refers to the reunion of a couple after they lose touch or break up. This is likely a perfect gift for a lover. Compared to a completely whole mirror, this object offers a possibility instead of a solution.

            However, “Form follows FUNCTION” is still one-sided determinism, only from the designer or maker’s perspective. But they — designers and makers — never know how users will use their products. When I was living in Shanghai, I saw a pedlar using an umbrella as a show shelf, displaying fake jewelry (fig.8). Italian designer Ettore Sottsass<sup>4</sup> once said, “Everyone has different ‘FUNCTION’ or necessities… Maybe a young man wants to put his rolls in a container, whereas a young woman wants to put all her books there… There is no generic FUNCTION. FUNCTION is life. I cannot foresee FUNCTION.” Form follows FUNCTION predefined by the designer, but the user can accept, reject or develop this prefabricated FUNCTION. I am interested in those objects that can be used with totally different FUNCTIONS and narrations relative to their forms. It is like using same words to make different sentences. Or maybe there is just one single sentence, and different readers interpret it in different ways. That’s the main idea of my second series.

          <h2>2. Collection series</h2>
          <p>
            My second series is actually my “collection”, rather than my “design” because I didn’t make the objects in this series. Instead I sort and collate objects from a user’s perspective. My first collection is <i>“Stamp Collection”</i> (fig.9). I was inspired by my teacher Karel Martens’<sup>5</sup> works. He made many prints using readymade objects as stamps. All the objects are flat, at least on one side, allowing them to be used as stamps. Compared to Karel, I focus more on stamps, the tool, instead of the final product, the prints. What does a stamp consist of? If we follow Heidegger’s example of analyzing a jug by splitting it into several parts<sup>6</sup>, then a stamp can be taken apart to yeild at least two parts: a flat surface, and a handle (fig.10-11). These two parts anchor each end of the object so that people can exert force while stamping. Most objects in Karel’s collection are just thin, flat metal pieces without any handle. I assume he must use them with other tools to do the stamping. Therefore, they are not TYPICAL stamps. A TYPICAL stamp is an object that has two ends: one end is a flat surface that does the printing, and the other end is a handle that is held in someone’s hand. Using this knowledge, I collected many objects, all of which can be used as stamps, with a flat surface and a handle: bowl cover, toy spare part, kitchen funnel, etc.

          <p>
            My <i>“Ring Collection”</i> is based on the same concept (fig.12). I collected objects which formally can be considered rings. I regard each ring as a composition (fig.13-14) of two parts: one part for wearing on a finger, and the other part for decoration (or showing off). This methodology of disassembling the object is inevitably limited by my personal way of thinking, which is probably arbitrary. This is why I didn’t choose a single object to misread it. I did not randomly name any tiny piece of metal fitting as a ring. Instead of doing that, I tried to find a series of objects so that I could “misunderstand” and “misuse” them over and over again. I tried to tell a lie one thousand times to make it true. I didn’t change any of the existing objects. Instead, on purpose, I misread their formal language. I am selling these two collections in my online grocery named “Currently Available” (<a href="http://currently-available.com" target="_blank">http://currently-available.com</a>). This is a small attempt on business, rather than design, because the idea is to simply to sell one thing as another thing.

          <p>
            In the process of making these objects, I always ask myself: What am I doing? How can do I define these objects? Are they art pieces, or daily expendables? From one point of view, they are not objects set on a pedestal or in a pure white space, and they should not to be kept behind glass, stanchions or ropes that only allow watching and not touching. They are not about representation or performance. Instead they are more about FUNCTION. Their narration is expressed only in the context of everyday life. Their value can only be recognized when someone uses it, or at least, knows how to use it. They need to be purchased; they need to be clenched in a fist; they need to be passed from one hand to another. This is why I am running an online grocery to display and sell them, instead of displaying them in a gallery. This online grocery has been constructed in the name of narrative. From another point of view, if Roland Barthes’<sup>7</sup> words are still correct, if art is still about being perverse and fetishistic, then you can absolutely name these objects as art.
