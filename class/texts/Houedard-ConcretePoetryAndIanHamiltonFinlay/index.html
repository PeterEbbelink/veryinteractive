            ‘Unforutnately, & especially in Germany, concrete poetry has become a fashion in the last years’ Eugen Gomringer wrote me in July: in Great Britain the only readers with access to concrete poetry have been subscribers to TYPOGRAPHICA & to POTH & fishsheet (edited and designed by Ian Hamilton Finlay & Jessie McGuffie at The Wild Hawthorn Press, Edinburgh): the summer poetry number of The Aylesford had Finlay’s valentine.
          </p>
          
Central interest here: relation of new typography & new poetry — place of this in new kinetic/spatial dimensions of art today — significance of fact that Finlay, leading concrete poet in Great Britain, is typographer and toymaker as well as poet.

Contemporary concrete poetry began in 1953 with avenidas mujeres by Eugen Gomringer, (born in Bolivia 1925, started the eugen gomringer press at Frauenfeld, Switzerland, 1960, where he edits konkrete poesie/poesia concreta). The history of concrete poetry can be pushed further back; it’s roots: the origin of all graphics — cave-paintings pictographs ideograms alpahabets hieroglyphs — any concrete medium to be looked at as well as through — any words treated as friends not slaves — as holy not débris. Texts created for concrete use: amulets talismans grigris mani-walls deviltraps kemioth tefillin mezuzahs medas sacred-monograms.

Or mediaeval mason’s marks, 18th-century cyphers, 19th-century trademarks — all objects as well as signs. Mysteria & sacramenta — veiling/revealing — forerunners named in 1958 pilot plan: Mallarmé Pound Joyce Cummings Apollinaire: parallel explorers: Webern Boulez Stockhausen & all concrete/electronic musicians (= space intervention in time-art of music); Mondrian & Max Bill (= time interventions in spatial, visual arts). 1963 Manifeste names Morgenstern Albert-Birot Schwitters Hugo Ball Seuphor Raoul Hausmann some Surrealists Expressionists Lettrists. Richard Hamilton in Typographica 3: POETS who use layouts to reinforce poetic ideas (Marinetti Mayakovsky) or make pictures with type (Apollinaire); ARTISTS who use type to create messages as much pictorial as literary (Schwitters Picabia van Doesburg Lissitzky Boccioni). This puts concrete in a context that is currently fascinating critics and historians — the reincarnation of pre-WW/1 creativities in the post-WW/2 world.

In 100 years since Napoleon III’s Salon des Refusés 1863, 2 tendencies in modern art have been:

(1) the largely pre-WW/1 move to the authentic & non-memetic, a move powered by its own built-in nuclear proton-neutron drive:

(a) the necessary negative anti-past (but still creative) épurations of eg the dadaists & surrealism, the musque concréte of the Paris club d’essai neo-brutilists &c: image & sense smashing; iconoclastic & logoclastic: peristaltic, eliminative: CONSTRICTIVE CONTRACTIVE

(b) the affirmative pro-future creativeness on each side of the emotiona/cerebral (heart/mind or expressionist/cubist &c/&c) split like f I the fauves constructivists purists futurists suprematists: the electronic serialism of Radio Cologne musicians. CONSTRUCTIVE

(2) The largely post-WW/2 overspill to coexistentialism & mutual interpenetration, rejection of divides & borders, delight in accepting ambiguity/ambivalence: alive blurring of frontiers between art & art, mind & mind, world & world, mind art & world. New Dada New Anarchism oecumenical beat-bop P & J, New Directions, New Departures, New Waves, New Winds, New Typography: humanist planetarization of this shrinking world. SPATIAL COEXISTENTIAL

PURE CONCRETE

The 3 major statements on pure concrete poetry to date have been: the Gomringer articles (1954, 56, 58, 60) collected in the constellations 1963; the Brazilians’ pilot plan 1958 and the 2 manifestates & projet of Pierre Garnier 1963.

Concrete Poetry is today: it is Afterbeat — history cycle of rhythm-form verse is closed. Concrete poetry can be semantic (pure) or nonsemantic, mutatis mutandis however, each comes from the 3 tendencies of modern art & is constrictive (contractive), constructive & coexistential. It reduces language (verbiage & syntax) to a minimum, the LCM of nouns; it makes poem-objects; it overspills in every direction, primarily to typography ‘Ikon & Logos are one’ (Hugo Ball 12 june 1916), secondarily to all spatialising art today. New poetry is CONCRETE because it is a poetry of nouns, words for concrete things, also because it makes poems that are concrete objects themselves, not windows into souls; it is SPATIAL because it creates its own space. Pure (semantic) concrete is the poetry of Finlay, of Gomringer, the Brazilians & Pierre Garnier, of the Japanese Kitasono Katué & Kobayashi.

constricting language: concrete is part of 1963 scene: speaking and writing are getting shorter, snappier, whole sentences packing in a word, long phrases into initials. Mutual exchange between speaking and writing, often unnoticed in daily life, needs only to be pointed out & eg advertisements (pictographs, slogans) become new poetry. This simple direct diction in sign-like new poetry is making literature part of everybody’s life (of Hans Arp on Hugo Ball 1932 trans Eugene Jolas ‘thru language too man can grow into life’): it reassets place in society of creative writers.

Absence of inflection & declension in words (infinitives used in French concrete); absence of syntax that gums words together in sentences: syntax replaced by typographic arrangement of words on page. As with ideograms, reader supplies missing links. Poem is kintic, forces reader to cross border & enter it. This syntax-absence (doubly oriental, like agglutinative Japanese, isolating Chinese) is very like Headlines, Titlepages, Telegrams, Pidgin, Posters. Like contemplation, goal of the poetry-purge was the wordless suprematist white on white, poeme blanc,  concrete fractures linguistics, atomises words into incoherence, constricting language to jewel-like semantic areas where poet & reader meet in maximum communication with minimum words.

Words: hard & lovely as diamonds demand to be seen, freed in space; words are wild, sentences tame them. Every word an abstract painting, read quickly in a phrase words get lost: in concrete, eye sees words as objects that release sound/thought echoes in reader. Opposition PLANE/IRON (AVION/FER) nothing to do with syllable count: difference between comfortable picture of The tiger on the river bank has come to quench its thirst, & the power of TIGER. The Logos as one-word poem OM, one-stroke timeless ikon.

constructive: concrete poems just ARE: have no outside reference: they are objects like TOYS & TOOLS (toys can be tools), jewel-like concrete things-in-them-selves, pretiosa; a placed comma, a flower, a blank, something admired in the tokonoma. Constellations: the simplest possible in use of words - just word-groups like star-groups. Concrete poetry is ‘I’-less ego-less self-effacing, not mimetic of the poet, not subjective (at least explicitly). Poet: dissolves, issue no orders to reader who has to provide his own mind-gum-sytax. Readers no bossed — hence new poetry is new anarchy of free symbiosis, like looking at non-demanding nature, viewer sees image of himself. Like mysticism, and zen, breakthru in Oxford semantic problems. Like Ginsberg in Pa’lante: ‘Give up any poem-practice depending on living inside the structure of language - on words as the medium of conscious being.’ Existential source of contradiction (objectivity/subjectivity) disappears.

Concrete poetry communicates its own structure: is an object in & by itself. Its material: word (sound, visual shape, semantical charge): its problem: the function and relation of this material; factors: nearness & similarity - gestalt psychology; rhythm: relational force. Like cybernetics: the poem as self-regulating machine. Concrete poems can be dull amusing grand starical playful sad - anything except epic. ‘Help serious thought & mind play; concrete poet: play - expert making speech - rules’ (Gomringer: independently of Wittgenstein?). The constructed poem attracts: it is human, friendly, makes words move on the page - they move as quick as the eye the poem attracts. Eyeverse is not ‘read’ - it creates an impression through the gestalt shape of the whole toy-tool, architected, poem - through each word as the eye wanders over them in any order.

coexistential overspill & boundary blurring: concrete poetry begins by being aware of graphic space as its structural agent, as the cosmos in which it moves, the universe into which it turns the page, the book. A printed concrete poem is ambiguously both typographic-poetry and poetictypography - not just a poem in this layout, but a poem that is its own type arrangement. Hence many type layouts are poems. A concrete poem like ideograms, advertisements, posters, creates a specific linguistic area - verbicovisual - with the advantages of nonverbal communication. It advertises itself. Nonsemantically this overspills in direction of Diter Rot, of typograms & typikons.

Concrete poems: dynamic structures - exist in tension between poem-object & space-time: motorised semantic-poetry not around yet but concrete is mobile, kinetic-spatial, by its typographic life. Its effect on eye: perceptive ambivalence. The shrinking world: contracted/constricted negatively by bomb & spacefears, positively by jet-communications telstar space-probe. This makes coexistantialism inevitable, international: ie, all arts merge, barriers crumble, are scrambled (sculpture sonore, mechanismed frescoes); new semantic eyeverse through new physiognomical typography & suprematist care for space, shares space-time spatial-kinetic concern of all forward-moving art. Battle of typograph & poet (form & content) is over - poet & typographer (soul & eye) must balance in same person: his the total responsibility before language, to create precise problems & solve them in terms of visual language. A general art of the world.

NONSEMANTIC CONCRETE

This like Alan Davie’s poesy (cf Michael Horovitz’s new Methuen) canspill over into jazz & paint, & painting spill over him into life. Zen immediacy, the unwordable problem of the non & the non-non. Nonsemantic is even more concrete, more self-communicative. Overspill into EARVERSE (poésie à lire): sonorisms like f i sound poems invented by Hugo Ball 1915: n. 1 gadgi beri bimba; Schwitters’ beautiful priimiitittii (transition n.3): grim glim gnim bimbim (mécano  4-5 1923) & classical Primordial Sonata (Ursonate, based on Hausmann’s fmsbw: 1924-33); or hans g helm’s ‘FA:M’AHNIESGWOW’ structures developing this with stronger almost eyeverse typographic attention; all serial electronic music beginning early 50s at Radio Cologne (Stockhausen Boulez &c). Even Schwitters’ W poem 1924 (began soft ended loud at 1st performance). EYEVERSE (poésie visuelle): lie f i Francis Picaba’s typographic poem-portrait of Tristan Tzara 1918, Diter Rot’s boks, Japanese brush paintings, Alcopley’s poetry without words, John Furnival’s space elaborations, tornpaper doily-poems. Reduced to suprematist ultimate, white on white, & poème blanc for ian hamilton finlay.

Nonsemantic overspills further to f i nature/art ambiguities of Kaprow’s Yard & Combines; Rauschenberg’s Assemblages; Dine’s Collages & the Paris New Realism; New York Happenings; the Amsterdam Dylaby (dynamic labyrinths of Rauschenberg Raysse de Saint-Phalle Tinguely Ultveldt & Daniel Sporri himself a concretista); to current motorised painting & sculpture, mobile frescoes, sculptures sonores, pyromagnétiques, hydrauliques; lumino-dynamid creations lit from inside or outside; & true 3-d cinétisme plastique. All these: interart invasions, interpenetrations, coexistentialisms, mutual time-space interventions; kinetic, dynamic, spatial (cf useful survey of field work by Schöffer Malina Tinguely Calder Bury Le Parc Kosice Aubertin Takis Monari Vardenaga Boto & Hoenisch in UNESCO Courier September 1963) are concretic to nonsemantic concrete/spatial poetry: they are the background of pure concrete, the world of the ‘création d’objets sonores poétiques ou visuels’, a world where fauves & suprematists meet - in scotland it is where they meet in a toymaker.

IAN HAMILTON FINLAY

Poet typographer toymaker - poetographer typographer toypographer - poetoypographer. As pure concrete poet Finaly is interested in contracting & constricting language into semantic economies: in purity. As typographer, in constructing these economies visually: at letting them create their space & move through it. As toymaker: in giving the thing its sense of the sacred, the unique, individual, irreplaceable, human, friendly. He makes ikon & logos one. Hatred either of current age of dead dead past, of the condition humaine, of contingency & pressure - all that is implied & everytime in whatever is new. It needn’t be expressed. It never is in Finlay. In a note he sent for this article ‘. . . so concrete is a non-syntax noun poetry (of things) & demands a new cohesive element (syntax being the old cohesive element). I also make wooden toys. I like toy poems. The toy is not cold, but is also un-connnected; ie, it is pure. But brims with feeling. It is open in the right way. The new poetry will be a poetry without the word ‘I’. It will be silent, & will be a sign of peace & sanity. I think the poets should bear the anguish of not writing anguish poems. I think self poetry is bad, now. My own concrete poems are of 2 kinds - one corresponding to fauve paintings (in feeling) & one to suprematism. They are not ambitious. I try to make them exact.’

Ian Hamilton Finlay, one of the major figures in the international concrete scene, & member for Scotland of the Comité International, is still, even at this late date, one of the few concrete poets in Great Britain (others? Edwin Morgan, Anselm Hollo, not many more). He is Scottish: born 1925. He has spent nearly all his life in Scotland - often in the islands and preferably on the island of Rousay in the Orkneys - in Finlay fishing-boats seasounds lobster-pots & potato-drills never seem far off however loud Edinburg children play outside The Wild Hawthorn Press in Fettes Row. His centrality, verticality, love of the small & beautiful & friendly, the peedie & wee, have given something terribly very gentle & personal to his impersonal concrete. His love of humor (& trouble), of trout strong tea & rain - his sense of tradition - make ‘this strange place, the world, a home’: his awareness of this strangeness of the place, of the need for poets, for poetoypography, to make it unstrange, is his opening to the nonsemantic. Things said about him on the BBC, in newspapers & pamphlets, have made him sound more like Tristan Tzara & Paris Dada than he could possibly be. Like Radio Newsreel reported that his airship, The Wild Hawthorn Zeppelin, was going to bombard the 1962 Festival Writers’ Conference; his Wild Hawthorn March was banned by Edinburgh magistrates; & a radio broadcast put out the rumor that 50,000 supporters of the Glasgow Rangers were going to demonstrate in favor of Shimpei Kusano the Frog Poet & the Wild Hawthorn. The Canadian Radio came over to record the Zeppelin attack - they had it seems heard about it from the French Radio. Airship March & Demonstration, too beautiful to be true, were in fact entirely mythical. But not his poetry, not his toys, not his success in making this strange place, the world, a home for others. If Finlay links with early dada, it is with the earliest of all, with Hugo & Emmy Ball in Zurich 1916, with Schwitters who shocked the German Dadaists by his love of tradition, & whose mot DIE KUNST ERFULLT is Finlay’s motto ART FULFILLS. This is the dada that 50 years ago was hominising the strangeness, not the later more popular movement to demonstrate the strangeness, to expose the unclearness, the illogic of it all.

In this heart-mind split, this poet-typographer of fauve-suprematist or surrealist-constructivist split, Finlay has reached a balance, an integration, that is valid for all art craft & life: ‘intellect helps make beauty by organizing, by being not clear not clever: not by indulging sick self’.

In 1962 he and Jessie McGuffie started POTH, a 9” x 12” poetry folder that in eleven numbers so far (at the incredible price of ninepence monthly) has published among others Voznesensky Kusano Günter Grass Cesar Lopez ee cummings August de Campos Anslem Hollo Edwin Morgan Jonathan Williams; poets from America Brazil Cuba Finland Germany Hungary Japan Russia Scotland Serbia Shetlands. In 1963 (one number so far) he started the 8” x 15” broadside Fishsheet specially for concrete, but his own stuff mostly is published abroad - America Brazil Jpana. His plays have been performed in Scotland England America & Canada. He exhibits poems and toys at the Edinburg Festival.

At others presses he has published The Sea Bed & Dancers Inherit the Party; at his own presses (Wild Hawthorn and Wild Flounder): Glasgow Beasts, An A Burd - Haw, An Inseks, An, Aw, A fush (4 editions, out of print) - the microscopic book that has had all the success of Schiwtters’ 1919 merz poem n. 1 Anna Blossom Has Wheels (Anna Blume): it was attacked by Hugh Macdiarmid in the now equally rare pamphlet The Ugly Birds Without Wings; Concertina, a tiny endless source of typographic/poetic pleasures that unfolds like contabulated postcards at the seaside; Rapel (10 suprematist and fauve poems) - September 1963, price 20s - from which some of the poems presented here have been taken.


The logos & the ikon are one (Hugo Ball 1916).
Poems should not be written for reasons other than
those dealing directly with words sounds & letters
(Schwitters to Hausman 1946).
