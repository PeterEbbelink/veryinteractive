            Jack Balkin: Have graphic designers moved toward producing platforms, instead of producing contained works?
            </p><p>
            Dan Michaelson: Yes, and that's where the focus of my classes lies in particular.
            </p><p>
            J: What kind of platforms might you teach your students how to create?
            </p><p>
            D: One project in my class is to make a content management system. That's a very 
            open-ended project, but the problems are straightforward: you've got to ﬁgure out what 
            the content should be, and that's a decision up to each individual designer in this case. 
            But to create a healthy ecosystem around that content, you've got to ﬁgure out how are 
            you asking users to enter and structure their content, how are you transforming that 
            content through algorithm, and ﬁnally how you're presenting that content.
            </p><p>
            J: It sounds to me like a lot of what they're doing is they're engaged in software design? 
            </p><p>
            D: To me there's a fuzzy spectrum between graphic design, which might ask: "what 
            does the interface look like?", and software design, which asks: "what's the algorithm 
            beneath the surface that's organizing the data."
            </p><p>
            J: So we begin the conversation with the transformation of graphic design from an 
            earlier model (things like advertisements or posters). You're saying, "What do I do as a 
            graphic designer, when I'm asked by a client not to create a single unitary object, but to 
            create a platform which others in the business will use. We want it to be functional for 
            the goals that the client wants, but we also want it have aesthetic consistency and 
            appeal." That's what you're trying to do right now?
            </p><p>
            D: We can think of it a little more broadly. It should have a feeling that isn't just a visual 
            feeling, but a feeling about the way it works and the cultural messages it's transmitting. 
            And it should evolve over time in a healthy way. When you come back to this platform a 
            year from now, it could be worse or it could be better, and we're engineering something 
            that's going to be better.
            </p><p>
            J: A lot of that depends on two things: ﬁrst, the amount of leeway put into the original 
            system. And second, the ability of the system to be generative. You can have a system 
            that has a lot of leeway, but you can't build anything with it, because you haven't 
            included the tools to build something new.
            </p><p>
            It's the placement of these generative tools in the system that allows you to be surprised when you come back in a year. Do you think there's a natural analogy between this and 
            game design? An interesting game allows participants to do something the game 
            designer had not imagined.
            </p><p>
            D: That's often our goal.
            </p><p>
            J: The problem of platform design is like a miniature problem of governance. When you 
            create a platform for other people to use, they’re not going to call you at 3:00am every 
            night. Basically you've left it in their hands. Most of what you're doing is giving them the 
            ability to build out the site to whatever they need, and to prevent them from wrecking it, 
            crashing it, or exploiting other people. In a game context you have what are called 
            "exploits," which is where somebody uses the software functionality to gain an 
            advantage which others consider unfair. But in your context I assume this never 
            happens? Somebody might crash the platform you create, but you never get the idea of 
            people within the client creating problems like that.
            </p><p>
            D: They certainly might. We can talk about the Yale School of Art's own website as an 
            example. When the school asked my company to redesign it, we knew the school was 
            an incredibly vibrant community, where students unceasingly develop new ideas about 
            what art should be. So the website should be as dynamic as that. It should give 
            prospective and current students a window onto what it's like there. To accomplish that 
            the website should be updated daily, but the school has no staff to do that. So we 
            empowered all the students, staff, and faculty of the school to create and edit all the 
            pages of the website. I’m using the word “empowered” somewhat provocatively here.
            J: When you say you "empowered" them, what you did precisely was to give them all 
            accounts, and the accounts gave them the right to perform certain operations on the 
            site.
            </p><p>
            D: We did that, and we did a little bit more. We also designed a system that would be 
            easy enough for everybody to edit those pages without any technical training. In fact it’s 
            sort of fun to use. When you make a page, the system ensures that it’s always 
            somehow within our overall design for the website. But the process of editing also feels 
            creative. So there's a back and forth between our authorship as designers of the 
            platform, and individual authorship by people who make pages. That’s empowering in 
            one sense, which is that it lets you make something bigger than you knew how to make, 
            because of the engineering of this tool.
            </p><p>
            J: In the context of a platform like that, what empowerment means is precisely the ability 
            to make things given the rules of the game you set up. In your case, the constraints that 
            you're placing on users are that whatever they produce will more or less be aesthetically 
            consistent with the overall plan you had in mind. It might have certain elements that are 
            continuous through what they produce, it might have constraints on what kinds of colors or shapes, what kind of content they can upload. Those kinds of things are potential rule 
            sets.
            </p><p>
            D: In fact those encoded rules are what makes it fun to use this system, because if you 
            had to make every design decision all the time or write your own HTML code to make a 
            page, of course that kind of freedom is overwhelming in a number of ways.
            </p><p>
            To continue the story, the website has lived for six or seven years now and it still feels 
            new in many ways, which is remarkable. Some people say it's the best website they've 
            ever seen. Yet as more and more people have used the site it has evolved in several 
            ways. One is that there are some trends in the kinds of artworks that people make in the 
            school, that can be aggressive. Students at times have been interested in ﬂorescent, 
            collaged images for example, or they're interested in political imagery that might be 
            startling. So the website begins to look like their work.
            </p><p>
            J: Tell me what kind of things went wrong with the site.
            </p><p>
            D: The site gets hate mail on days when the design of it has become particularly 
            startling. Those can be legitimate complaints. “This whole website is ﬂashing at me. 
            Someone might have a seizure, and I can't ﬁnd what I'm looking for." On the other hand 
            not everyone is a good critic. It may be easy to ﬁnd what you’re looking for, you just 
            assume it’s not because some graphics have a bad association for you.
            </p><p>
            J: Does the staff take responsibility for the complaints and how people feel about it? In 
            other words, does the buck stop with them ultimately?
            </p><p>
            D: Maybe, but I'm not sure they'd say that. The language on the website says the 
            individual authors of each piece of content are responsible for it.
            </p><p>
            The way we've resolved conﬂicts up to now has been informal. Do you remember the 
            controversy in the art school a couple years ago when an undergraduate artist claimed 
            to have made work using blood from an abortion? At the time I noticed someone had 
            put a dancing baby animated GIF on the art school website. So I simply told that person 
            and said I thought it was unhelpful to the conversation.
            </p><p>
            J: What you are putting into the ethos of graphic design is actually the creation of a 
            governance structure. There is a particular set of tasks that you want to achieve. You're 
            creating a space in which people can do things, they're trying to create aesthetic effects, 
            to be amusing, witty, profound, emotionally affecting, whatever their goals are, but 
            you've created a place for them to do that. There are certain rules. Some of the rules 
            are built into the code, that is, they just can't do certain things because the code doesn't 
            let them do it, and certain things are enabled by the code, and they could actually do 
            things more powerfully if the code was changed to allow them to do it. But that's just the part of the governance that's produced by the software. There is also a set of communal 
            norms that develop as the space proceeds through time. These communal norms are 
            not necessarily predictable from the original design.
            </p><p>
            And to some extent, it's the participants who govern themselves through informal 
            communication with each other, their give-and-take with each other. They are relying on 
            the fact that most of the people who work there understand themselves to be part of a 
            community, and won't demand more than they should. It is possible that someone might 
            behave badly, or they might behave in a way that is insensitive to others. At that point, 
            there will be other varying social norms that will be brought to bear on that person in 
            order to get them to behave. So that is another kind of governance, the governance of 
            social norms.
            </p><p>
            So we have the governance of the code, which is largely the designer's doing, and 
            which both constrains and enables, on the one hand. And then we have the governance 
            of the community that is using that code, based on social norms and the idea that 
            people want to be well thought of. And ﬁnally, the third story is one of charismatic 
            authority, a professional authority, in which you have a student who is not behaving. He 
            doesn't seem to be able to pick up the cues about how to behave in this particular kind 
            of conversation about abortion, for example, so you actually show up, and say, "I am 
            your teacher,” or "I am a person you respect," and I'm saying “Don't do this.” You are 
            relying on these forms of authority in order to get the student to back down. Which, I 
            take it in this case, he did.
            </p><p>
            That that is another form of governance, it is the governance of a structure outside of 
            the graphic design teacher-student relationship, which is basically parasitic on your 
            position in the university and the student's position in the university. And possibly based 
            upon the student's sense of respect for you as an artist, or someone who knows more 
            than they do.
            </p><p>
            You can think about a graphic design project like the one you are describing through the 
            lens of art or creativity, but we have just shown how the project can also be viewed 
            through the lens of governance. What looks like a graphic design project is actually a 
            governance structure, which has multiple overlapping forms of power and authority.
            D: Of course we could also look at it the opposite way. In my classes I’m trying to 
            convince students that what looks like a governance structure is actually a graphic 
            design project.
            </p><p>
            J: Exactly! That is exactly right. We can look at it in two equal ways. It is a duck-or-rabbit 
            situation. Sometimes it looks like a duck, sometimes it looks like a rabbit.
            </p><p>
            Is there anyone who has thought that what was done on the site was illegal?D: Yes, I’m sure that at times copyright law has been broken during the use of this 
            website.
            </p><p>
            J: There is a further background set of power relations: the state. For example, there 
            are questions about who is responsible if copyrighted material is uploaded onto the site. 
            Is it the student who uploaded the material, or the school, or the university? Are the 
            individuals who work in the art department responsible? Or is the original designer 
            responsible, for having created a system that made it so easy for people to violate 
            copyright?
            </p><p>
            You are always doing all of this stuff—these various intersecting governance structures 
            we call the graphic design project—against the background of the law. So the graphic 
            design project is not only itself a mini-world of governance, with multiple overlapping 
            forms of authority, it's also embedded in a larger system of governance, which is the 
            state.
            </p><p>
            D: We could go a little bit further. Graphic design interacts with the law not only through 
            code functionality, social norms, and charismatic authority, but also through the formal 
            qualities of the interface design. Does the visual design encourage you to make 
            collages of other people's work, or does the visual design frame images in thumbnails? 
            You actually hinted at this perspective early on.
            </p><p>
            J: Depending on how you design the tool kit and how you display the result of 
            operations within the system, people will be tempted or driven to do things one way 
            rather than another, because of the aesthetic consequences of what they do.
            </p><p>
            D: That's right. So that suggests another question about trying to predict and inﬂuence 
            consequences. You observed that these systems are so complicated and chaotic that 
            we can't predict what's going to happen a few years down the road. But we can 
            inﬂuence it a little bit, or we can inﬂuence some qualities of it. 
            Taking another step back, I wonder whether there is an analogy to the interpretive 
            function of law. When does the role for lawyers or law students extend to trying to shift 
            the cultural landscape, creating a system of governance better than the one that 
            preceded it? Does this only happen in legislatures, which is where we expect it to 
            happen?
            </p><p>
            J: I think the idea of interpretation is not appropriately posed here yet. Let's talk about 
            the different forms of power and authority that were implicit in your platform. Remember 
            we had the code, we had the community norms, we had the institutional and charismatic 
            authority, and underpinning it was the the power of the state, the regulations of the state 
            as to who would be responsible for what was done on the platform. It's a very complex picture. It's going to turn out that the issue of interpretation will look different with 
            respect to each of these.
            </p><p>
            Suppose we think about the question of the code, the basic design. Code-based 
            systems of power are rigid. At the code level, the kind of interpretation we think of with 
            respect to law doesn't apply. It either works or it catastrophically fails.
            </p><p>
            On the other hand, when we move to the second form of authority, the authority of 
            community norms, we are back in interpretation space. As people act within the space, 
            and they add new art and do things to other people's art, norms emerge. The software 
            may not limit the kind of operations they can do, but as a matters of norms, they might 
            consider it impolite to do something to somebody else's work, for example to change too 
            much of it. And unlike the code, people can have arguments over whether the norms 
            have been breached or not. 
            </p><p>
            D: If what you can do is make thumbnails, what happens when someone creates a 
            mosaic of many thumbnails to create a larger image. You can exploit the possibilities 
            afforded by the code to create outcomes that are—it's not a catastrophic failure, I would 
            say, and may or may not be a failure.
            </p><p>
            J: That is a creative—
            </p><p>
            D: It may be a failure, though. You can imagine cases where it is debatable as to 
            whether that kind of creative abuse of the system is healthy or unhealthy. 
            J: So the world of interpretation arises at the moment when you have norms that can be 
            argued about. The argument is not about whether the code permits it, it's about whether 
            you and I should do it.
            </p><p>
            D: True. But when something does go wrong, when people agree that the behavior of 
            the system is unhealthy, what can happen is someone calls me to change the code. So 
            there are linkages among these layers of governance.
            </p><p>
            J: And at that point, you they are asking you to make a normative judgment about 
            whether or not the code is being appropriately used. And if you agree that it is being 
            inappropriately used, what do you do?
            </p><p>
            D: We alter the design, or we alter the code. Either could be appropriate to adjust the 
            balances within this ecosystem so it works better moving forward.
            </p><p>
            J: So what you've done is you've readjusted the code substrate—you've readjusted the 
            part of the governance scheme that is in code—
            </p><p>
            D: And in code, could also be what it looks like, right...?
            </p><p>
            J: Right. The appearance is emergent from the code.
            </p><p>
            D: That's right.
            </p><p>
            J: And then you hope it will have a beneﬁcial effect on the norms.
            </p><p>
            Similarly, we talked about the authority of the institution in which the space is located. 
            The university, for example. Or the student-teacher relationship. This is a social 
            conﬁguration and also subject to interpretation. With the student who posted the 
            dancing baby, what ﬁrst looks like "It would be better if you didn't do this,” turns into a 
            discussion about how the student is supposed to behave toward you and is the student 
            in fact behaving inappropriately.
            </p><p>
            D: True. There is a rule against censorship in the art school which predates the website. 
            I didn't delete it for him, or tell him he had to delete it. I told him it would be better for the 
            school if it weren't there. A distinction which is certainly subject to interpretation.
            J: You are saying, I'm not in violation of the preexisting norms about censorship of 
            students. You can imagine the student pushing saying, if this is not an attempt to censor 
            me, then what is?
            </p><p>
            D: Right.
            </p><p>
            J: That is the sphere in which interpretation occurs. Finally, when we think about the 
            substrate of state power, and the laws about who would be responsible and whether the 
            uploading particular images would violate copyright and all of that, that's also in the 
            realm of interpretation, because it is not like code in the on-off sense, it's like norms. 
            The laws of the state are like the norms of the community, or the professional norms of 
            the institution. They just happen to be in a different location.
            </p><p>
            D: To ﬁnish the story of what happened at the school of art: some years after the launch, 
            we noticed that the website was down and displaying its test pattern error page. The 
            site had been featured on Reddit and the trafﬁc had crashed it. And the reason for that 
            was because it had been nominated as the worst website of 2010, and had won.
            </p><p>
            J: Why was it nominated as the worst website of 2010?
            </p><p>
            D: Mainly because it was so graphically aggressive, as far as I can tell.
            </p><p>
            J: So everything was attributed—the site, its design, the whole thing—to what happened 
            to be on the site at that particular time.
            </p><p>
            D: That's true, and it's an interesting mistake, but the site is also like that often. So it's 
            not an unfair opinion, either.
            </p><p>
            J: We have been talking about norms and the locations of the norms, and how they are 
            embedded in other systems of norms. The story about Reddit is interesting because it's 
            a story in which this site, for the community of students within Yale, was also embedded 
            in the public sphere outside of Yale. You could have made it only available to the Yale 
            community.
            </p><p>
            D: Right. We had said we wanted the site to be well-liked by two groups: people in the 
            School of Art community, and people who want to join that community, that is, 
            prospective students.
            </p><p>
            J: By inserting it into the public sphere, you made a conscious decision. The site was no 
            longer understood as an exercise, a part of students’ education. It was thrown into a 
            conversation about appropriate norms in the public sphere in general. Not about 
            appropriate behavior within the conﬁnes of the university.
            </p><p>
            D: Right. And people may even debate the success of the site as a system of 
            governance. My favorite comment from the Reddit thread was: "Hey, this is a wiki, you 
            can't blame the designers, it's changing all the time." And its reply: "Well, now we know 
            that's not a good idea.”
            </p><p>
            J: They said, in effect, somebody screwed up the code. "They didn't design it the right 
            way in the ﬁrst place."
            </p><p>
            D: It was a great conversation.
            </p><p>
            J: So here is another sphere of interpretation. Because it's contestable. People could 
            dispute what the norms are, their application, and their values.
            What's the relationship between aesthetics and governance in the design of a site like 
            Twitter or Google?
            </p><p>
            D: There is a relationship between form and function, which is famously slippery. The 
            formal choice to limit the size of the input box on Twitter becomes a functional choice 
            that users should adapt to that limitation. Ways of speaking within that limitation then 
            become extremely creative.
            </p><p>
            J: Do the decorative elements of the design play any role in authority, power, 
            governance?
            </p><p>
            D: I was wondering whether that was more of what you were getting at, when you used 
            the word "aesthetic."
            </p><p>
            J: What we are doing is, we are breaking this out into little bits. We talked about form 
            and function, and we now talk about decorative elements and their role. 
            </p><p>
            D: For example, Google’s famously minimal visual design, does that result in governing 
            norms that are different than a site that is more visually rich?
            </p><p>
            J: Is that just a matter of “Oh I like it,” or “I didn't like it”? To what extent when you think 
            about graphic design are you thinking about the political effects of design choices?
            D: On the one hand, Google’s absolute simplicity makes it easier to scan the search 
            results to ﬁnd what you’re looking for from a seemingly unedited list. But at the same 
            time, the feeling that the design is minimal, also telegraphs the idea of that function. So 
            people get the impression that Google values their judgment. The aesthetic design 
            gives the impression of democracy.
            </p><p>
            J: On one hand we have what we might call the power relations of the design, that 
            comes from its function, and on the other hand, we have the decorative features which 
            either can reinforce or conﬂict with these functional aspects. 
            </p><p>
            D: Form can also mask a hidden function. That seemingly transparent list of search 
            results has been pre-processed for you in ways that can be pretty opaque.
            </p><p>
            J: We can think about law in terms of its structure: its penalties and pains, its incentive 
            forms, its subsidizations and refusals to subsidize, the use of channeling functions, 
            framing, effects. All of those features makes law a governance system, like graphic 
            design. Law also has another realm, the realm of social meaning. That is what we are 
            analogizing to the decorative aspect, the blank screen in Google. It has a semiotic 
            feature: What do things mean? What do they seem to be like? What do they symbolize? 
            If you think about law in those terms, the number of associations is just overﬂowing: 
            what courtrooms look like, what kind of clothing lawyers wear, how police wear their 
            uniforms, how you design a prison, how legislatures meet in these huge buildings.
            </p><p>
            And it would have the same kind of relationship that you just explained to me in the 
            relationship between the functional aspect of the Google search page, and the 
            decorative aspect of the Google search page. These things can either reinforce each 
            other, they can be in conﬂict with each other, one of them can disguise or mask the 
            other. The "I'm feeling lucky" button sends a message of personal empowerment, which 
            mystiﬁes or disguises its function.
            </p><p>
            D: It's a common role for advertising and design: to make us comfortable with something we were previously uncomfortable with.
            </p><p>
            J: It makes us acquiesce, it makes us accept, in the same way as the relationship 
            between the social meanings produced by legal institutions, and the functional aspects 
            of the power relations in legal relationships. It might even be inappropriate to divide 
            them. In practice they might just be merged in ways that are very difﬁcult to sort out.
            </p><p>
            Law has its effects through creation of social meaning. And its social meaning then 
            creates conﬁdence, acquiescence, docility, fear, expectation, patriotism, it has all these 
            effects on populations. Lawyers who like to be tough guys like to say it's all about 
            incentives in the simple sense of whether or not it would cost me or it would cost me 
            less. But it’s also about what things mean, how you apprehend what is going on before 
            you. So when you apprehend Google, the page, what you see before you is a clean 
            page that appears to put you in the driver's seat. It creates the image of your 
            empowerment. It's not just a question of incentives. It’s a question of what the Google 
            page means to you.
