        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        </p><p>
        1. Chose a well-known person, company, or other presence on Twitter. This person/company/presence should, on a regular basis, tweet.
        </p><p>
        2. Create a new Twitter account specifically for this assignment.
        </p><p>
        3. For five out of seven days a week for the duration of the 12-week course, make a visual tweet. A visual tweet...<br />
        — has dimensions 700 x 700px<br />
        — is in either .jpg or .png file format<br />
        — includes one of your chosen person/company/presence’s tweets<br />
        — includes a separate image, graphic, and/or other visual element<br />
        — should not take longer than 20 minutes to create
        </p>

        <h2>Guidelines</h2>
        </p><p>
        This project is an exercise in endurance. By the end of the 12-week course, you will have 60 “visual tweets”, showing some sort of evolution over time.
        </p><p>
        This project is good testing ground: You should try new techniques and surprising combinations. No single “visual tweet” you make is that important since there will be many. Remember to not spend more than 20 minutes on any single visual tweet.
        </p><p>
        At some point, these visual tweets should be worthwhile to show an audience. After a week or two of tweeting, think about encouraging people to follow you. There are various ways to grow and interact with an audience, but one method is to follow those people who you hope follow you back in return.
        </p><p>
        Before you begin, consider your general approach to the visual tweets. What is your source material like? What are the tweets about? If you set up a personal constraint, what is it? Remember that at the end, you will be viewing all 60 visual tweets as an archive, showing their trajectory over time.

        <h2>In conclusion</h2>
        </p><p>
        For now, focus strongly on doing these visual tweets as regular exercise, growing and maintaining your creative muscle. 
        </p><p>

        People may lose 20 to 40 percent of their muscle — and, along with it, their strength — as they age. Scientists have found that a major reason people lose muscle is because they stop doing everyday activities that use muscle power, not just because they grow older.
