        <h2>Overall</h2>
        <p>
        You will be receiving weather data (i.e. the five day forecast of three different places) through an API. You must render it in your own way and display it on a webpage.

        <h2>Your mission</h2>
        <p>
        It is your responsibility to frame this weather data in a way you see useful and meaningful. This could be done simply be through specific styling of style.css, or you could also add other content to your site that gives the data new meaning. My only requirement is that you have at least the data for three different places of your choosing.

      <h2>A quote</h2>
      <p>
        “Everyone has a different ‘function’ or necessities. ... Maybe a young man wants to put his rolls in a container, whereas a young woman wants to put all her books there. I don’t know. There is no generic function. Function is life. I cannot foresee function. The furniture I have designed has always been functional. However, one needs to know what it is for.”<br />
        — Ettore Sottsass, Italian architect and designer
