      The weather data from at least three different cities that you include in your project should feel purposeful. It is your responsibility to frame this weather data in a way you see specific and memorable. This will be done by manipulating some very basic JavaScript and CSS styleguide in combination with your content that gives the data new meaning. For this project, I am most interested in surprise within functionality. I am also interested in pacing and change over time.
      </p><p>
      By the end of this project, you will learn the basic principles of working with dynamic data: how to test for different conditions and how to integrate static HTML and CSS around dynamic elements. If your project requires it, you may also learn some jQuery and JavaScript to create new data outcomes.
