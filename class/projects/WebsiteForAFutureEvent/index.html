      <section>
        Choose a future event. This could be an already-existing future event such as one within the Yale community. Or, this future even could be completely fictional altogether.
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Phase 1: <i>Artifacts</i></h2>
        <p>
          After choosing a future event, bring in at least 5 “visual artifacts” related to
the event. Some examples include...
        <ul>
          <li>— flyer or poster about event</li>
          <li>— event invitation with envelope</li>
          <li>— brochure of event agenda (if complex and spanning multiple days)</li>
          <li>— Google Map of event location(s)</li>
          <li>— event’s Facebook page</li>
          <li>— email thread between event collaborators (with attachments?)</li>
          <li><i>— You can find a more expansive list of possible artifacts below</i></li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        Each artifact should give some sense or glimpse into the event’s purpose and possible narrative. Think about the event over time, as these visual artifacts can be from all phases: the event planning, the event itself, and the event’s aftermath. You are imagining and creating these artifacts to begin wrapping your mind around your event and what it’s about. This is a preliminary phase; but please try to be as specific and detail-oriented as possible while creating your artifacts. These artifacts should not paint a complete picture; instead, they should make us want to know more about your event.
        </p>
        <p>
        If your event is already-existing (a “real” event), you can bring in some found artifacts. (For example: flyer, Facebook event page, etc.) You should still create 5 artifacts, but your found artifacts could possibly inform or guide your process.
        </p>
        <p>
        To complete this phase, present documentation of your 5 visual artifacts on a simple website linked to your class homepage.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Phase 2: <i>Event Website</i></h2>
        <p>
          Make a website providing information about your event. In this phase, focus on giving your event a distinct visual identity and language specific to your event.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your website should include... 
          <ul>
            <li>— the title of the event</li>
            <li>— the time and date of the event</li>
            <li>— the location of the event</li>
            <li>— a map of the event’s location(s)</li>
            <li>— a trace of the passing of time (in some way)</li>
            <li>— a piece of text (min 500 words) about or related to the event
            <li>— a navigation to view all these pieces</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          During this phase, please plan to produce one of your artifacts physically. A list of websites that produce physical artifacts from digital files is included below. 
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Phase 3: <i>Event Website as Time Capsule</i></h2>
        <p>
          Make either a separate website or an addendum to your current event
          website showing your event as you would like it perceived now that is over.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this website, include artifacts that are important for future visitors of your website to understand and reference your event. These artifacts could include the artifacts imagined and created in Phase 1, but please feel free to go further now that you have a better mental picture of your event. Your website should also include documentation of your physical artifact.

        <h2>In conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          This project is about visual identity over time. You’ll do this by first by creating 5 visual artifacts. Then, once the event is better formed in your mind, you’ll create a cohesive website for the event, focusing on giving your event a visual identity to transmit the event’s purpose and spirit. Finally, you’ll create an event time capsule — fit for the future.
