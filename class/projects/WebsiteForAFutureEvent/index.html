      This project is about visual identity over time. You’ll do this by first by creating 5 visual artifacts for your real or imagined future event. Then, once the event is better formed in your mind, you’ll create a cohesive website for the event, focusing on giving your event a visual identity to transmit the event’s purpose and spirit. Finally, after imagining your event has passed (if it hasn't already), you’ll create a future-proof event time capsule.
      </p><p>
      By the end of this project, you will have a living, breathing website that could easily live outside of this class. Additionally, you will know the basics of responsive design, as the event website should adapt to mobile platforms in some way. You will also have created your own visaul world by imagining the event over time and as a physical artifact, solidifying its identity.
