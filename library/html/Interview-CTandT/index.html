<blockquote><p>We have a basement filled with shoe boxes. Each shoe box contains about a month’s worth of things we’ve collected. The things range from business cards to sculptures. It’s like a stack of mini time capsules. Once in a while we open one up to look for something and end up re-discovering a whole bunch of other things we collected around the same time.

<blockquote><p>I think the latest thing we make is always the thing we’re most proud of.  All the things we could have done better are constantly bubbling up, so we’re always trying to improve our process even if the next project is a completely different thing.
</p></blockquote>
<hr/>
<blockquote><p>Both, but maybe not by choice.  When we first started out, we said yes to every single project that came our way. It was mostly building websites, and sometimes it was writing software for interactive installations.  We had to be flexible to feed ourselves.  As a studio, we never planned to write software for a living, but there’s a strong demand for it, so thankfully we know how to code. We always made things for ourselves and the hope of commercializing them as products comes every once in a while as a big bonus. I’d say we’re still in the middle of transitioning towards being mostly independent and less focused on client work.

<blockquote><p>Our first attempt at a product was our Blockhead Stem.  We first made a couple just for ourselves.  Once we started riding with them, people started asking about it, so we decided to make a few more to sell online. The response was encouraging. The way the design industry makes and sell things is changing really quickly, so It’s exciting to see what will happen in the next few years.

<blockquote><p>Practically anything we can do in-house, we do in-house. We’ve been skill hoarders mainly because it’s really fun. Each new skill we learn opens up a world of machinery, tricks, language, and design potentials.  That said, it’s always tempting to give up everything and become a super focused craftsperson like Jiro. (as in dreams of sushi)
</p></blockquote>
<hr/>
<blockquote><p>Absolutely. It often feels like you’re letting go of a baby, but in the best case scenarios, they come back full of great surprises. Expert knowledge and craft is hard to come by, but if you can pay for it, it’s always worth it.  In the worse cases, projects come back diseased, abused, and poisoned.  There are plenty of factories, companies, and individuals out there that act and talk like experts to make a buck.
</p></blockquote>
<hr/>
<blockquote><p>I’ve always had a fascination with clocks.  It’s maybe the most ubiquitous piece of machinery that governs our daily lives. We often use timepieces as a canvas to being an project. If we get a commission, we often begin by thinking about a new timepiece. We are all constrained by time and timekeeping.  So, any attempt to break out of that seems like a good cause.

<blockquote><p>Google Earth Clock is probably the most visually entertaining.  Counting to a Billion is maybe the most valuable, but potentially annoying timekeeping piece we have.

<blockquote><p>Many ideas behind computer science inspire our work.  Specifically the logic of computer architecture.  There are beautiful technological (and philosophical) ideas embedded inside every day computers, iPhones, etc.  We spend our days talking through computers, but never really pay attention to what’s inside.  So we like to do.  We also like writing code a lot.  We got serious with it in grad school thinking about how we could use it to make things we want for ourselves, and especially that you can make them really quickly with code.  Yeah, we like code because you can make things really fast.
