<h2>Interview with Anthony Antonellis</h2>
<div class="q"><p>You started out with a BFA in painting from the Savannah College of Art and Design. How did you get interested in internet-based art you seem to be focusing on now?</p></div>

<div class="a"><p>In grad school, I studied public art and artistic strategies, with public art meaning broadly any art work that doesn't go into pre-established institutions like galleries and museums but interacts with the public in other spaces. So the public that I became interested in interacting was the internet.</p>
</div>

<div class="q"><p>I can definitely see that interest in the intersection of real life gallery and museum spaces and online art spaces in some of your work--like <a href="http://www.putitonapedestal.com/" target="_blank">Put it on a Pedestal</a>, and <a href="http://www.anthonyantonellis.com/publicdomain/" target="_blank">Public Domain</a>. Can you explain the concepts behind those a little more?</p></div>

<div class="a"><p>Yes, those works are informed by traditional settings, sometimes in a way that's tongue in cheek--in both of those I prop In both of them up these things that have been discarded as non art and low-art. In some ways it also reflects the movement we are now seeing of growing institutional interest and media interest in internet art, which hadn't existed before.</p></div>

<div class="q"><p>So some people are taking these new forms of art and trying to fit them into older frameworks?</p></div>

<div class="a"><p>Yes, it's kind of like skeumorphism, this intersection of real life and online forms. At one point, I had been doing a series of GIFs that placed digital objects in conventional museum and gallery settings. For example: <a href="http://anthonyantonellis.com/jpg-gif/item/105-busyexhibitgif" target="_blank">the loading icons on pedestals</a>, <a href="http://anthonyantonellis.com/jpg-gif/item/106-ssgifgif" target="_blank">screen savers inside plexi boxes</a>, and <a href="http://anthonyantonellis.com/jpg-gif/item/99-311gif" target="_blank">screen savers</a> projected on to walls. These three elements came together into a single gif called <a href="http://anthonyantonellis.com/jpg-gif/item/109-exhibitgif" target="_blank">exhibit.gif.</a> A curator for an art show in Dublin approached me about staging a physical version of exhibit.gif within the show. The loading icons were projection mapped onto 3D printed shapes, the star field was projected onto the wall, and the screen savers were projection mapped into plexiglass pedestals. So it was a gallery installation trying to look like a gif trying to look like a gallery installation. </p></div>

<div class="q"><p>A lot of net artists seem to be interested in gifs. Why do you think that is?</p></div>

<div class="a"><p>Gifs are like sketches. They're quick, easy to throw together--I mean, you can work on them longer and make them slick, but you can also leave them raw. They're like short conversational pieces. You can use them to communicate with other artists, evolve a conversation with them. So yeah, gis are like the net art version of a sketch--they have that same gestural quickness.</p></div>

<div class="q"><p>You got a ton of press coverage for your <a href="http://www.anthonyantonellis.com/news-post/item/670-net-art-implant" target="_blank">implant of an NFC chip that stores digital artwork into your hand</a>. Can you explain the concept behind that piece?</p></div>

<div class="a"><p>That project was actually a successor to another project of mine, where I had artists designing the image to my credit cards. I was rotating the content of those cards as if they were a miniature exhibition space, and then planning to later have a proper website where everything would be exhibited. [...] So the chip became a replica of that, storing artwork in a self-contained space.</p></div>

<div class="q"><p>And can you describe the reaction to it? It seemed like it really grabbed the public's attention, even kind of played into some kind of fear of the future.</p></div>

<div class="a"><p>I thought that might have happened n the art world, but didn't expect it to cause that public reaction at all. The public interest in this far outweighed any sort of institution. I guess we're already to the point where there's a lot of paranoia, particularly with the NSA, other concerns about invasive technology. Wearable technology is also just finally coming to the public sphere. So I think there's osme topics that just happned to hit at the same time.</p></div>

<div class="q"><p>Do you feel that you're part of a "net art" community online? What does that community look like? Does it break down into any sorts of groups?</p></div>

<div class="a"><p>When I first came into net art [in 2011], Google+ had just came out, and it was really huge for about 3 months. During that time people came together and talked in a way that didn't happen before that. It networked together a lot of people who weren't on Facebook, Twitter, or other platforms. But Google+ ended up falling apart and a lot of people went elsewhere. I don't think there's any one location that everyone goes to anymore.. there's some people I only communicate with on Facebook, some on Instagram, some on Facebook some on vine.</p>

<p>I started this website called <a href="http://netartnet.net" target="_blank">netartnet.net</a>, trying to bring together people and projects and online galleries, kind of as a public service--with net art, you take so much that you want to give something back. There's a lot of online galleries popping up, but I'm also interested in a larger net art world that includes offline exhibitions and art fairs. Some people don't consider those offline exhibitions "net art" strictly, though--that's a debate.</p></div>

<div class="q"><p>Another thing I was curious about is what your early experiences with the internet were like, and how that's influenced your work today. It seems like a lot of net art is driven by a sort of nostalgia--people reusing materials from the early days of the internet.</p></div>

<div class="a"><p>Yes, I think that's true--in a way the nostalgia is part of a common language. It's also more experience based than simply attached to specific objects. What was different about the early internet was that it was so difficult to use as a person. You had to adapt to it, it didn't adapt to you at all. Websites were horribly designed, hard on the eyes, it was painful to download anything and video was out of the question. You had to work for everything.</p> 

<p>Now it's the exact opposite. The internet is designed to be totally ergonomic. I think certain net art projects are about validating that old feeling of incompatibility. Nowadays the internet is a more direct reflection of the rest the world.</p></div>

<div class="q"><p>Yeah, it seems like maybe part of the nostalgia is for a time when the internet was its own culture, and now it's so pervasive and so adaptable that it's lost that sense of a being a unique space.</p></div>

<div class="a"><p>Right. There's some projects trying to preserve that--Ryder Ripps is doing "Internet Archaeology," digging through a whole terabyte of Geocities files, finding the ruins of old artwork. They have a tumblr where they post screenshots from these old websites.</p>

<p>The other funny thing about the internet... well, have you heard of Olia Lialina? She created what she called the first real net art gallery. She's like the great grandmother of netart. But the thing is she's only about 40. She's very young and accessible.. A few decades ago, that's like ten thousand internet years ago. I'm still trying to figure out what the connections are between what net artists are doing now and those earlier days.</p></div>

<div class="q"><p>Some of your work seems pointed at the ways that net art art often resisted traditional art world concepts of original vs. forgery, and of ownership. Have you put net art up for sale? How does that work for you and other net artists?</p></div>

<div class="a"><p>Net art deals a lot with authorship, usership, and originality. I view originality as a cumulative process, each person adding there own snow to a snowball, one that existed before them, and will continue to exist after. Concerning the ubiquitous nature of digital works there can be be no one instance that more unique to another; even numbered editions would be impossible to maintain. When I place works into the public realm, it is with the intention that they continue or build off an existing dialog, and one of the greatest signifiers of their success in having done so, it to see other works informer, built off, or continuing in dialog with my work. </p>

<p>Artist's working in digital media have different ideas with how to approach unique objects, or editioned objects. For me I feel it is best to use the benefits of the digital to enhance and propagate an artwork, it seems counterproductive to try to limit a digital work to a single USB stick or closed collection. </p>

<p>With my works, I deal with what can be considered the origin versus the original. The way I have approached painting (in a digital sense) is that the paintings simply inform the artwork, the digital files. If the artwork was a play, the paintings act as a necessary prop, stage or character, but not the play itself. As an object, these physical paintings can be sold, but the artwork, the digital images, are places within a public common.</p>

<p> With other works I have grounded GIFs as lenticulars, as was the case with both the Photoshop Skillz GIFs and CMYRGB GIFs. Those GIFs cannot be sold, but their lenticular counterparts were. The artworks exist as content in both states, physical and digital, but limited to neither; not really different than a hand written book that becomes a hard cover or eBook. </p></div> 

<div class="q"><p>What do you see in the future for net art? And/or, what projects are you working on now or do you hope to work on?</p></div>

<div class="a"><p>When electricity was first introduced at a consumer level we saw ordinary objects like a coffee maker, stove, and iron become the electric coffee maker, the electric stove, and the electric iron. Once electricity became ubiquitous, that prefix was largely dropped and we don't really consider most objects by an electric versus non-electric dichotomy. The internet will continue to expand and saturate physical space, so I see the future of net art to be the term utterly dissolved back into fine art or art.</p>

<p>I'd like to think that is where my artwork picks up, in that after place. I'm currently working on an exhibition of digital landscape paintings. The content is based off spatial/directional data from brain waves using an EEG headset while dreaming. I'd like to continue to explore the quantified self, and to view human and digital interaction as a two-way conduit, where we extend ourselves as information.</p>

<div class="q">Other works to look at:</q>

	</ul>
</div>


<!-- <div class="q"><p>You mentioned earlier that some people don't consider offline exhibitions to be net art. Where do people draw the line? What makes your offline exhibitions net art?</p></div>

<div class="a"><p>So, one of my next exhibitions is actually all paintings. But what makes it net art is that the real art is the digital version of these paintings, which can be sent anywhere. I kind of got the idea when I trying to ship my sister a painting for a wedding gift and it was an inch over shipping size so it was going to cost over a $1000 to ship. Needless to say I didn't ship it. Selling an artwork is also actually very painful sometimes-it's really bizarre. You make this piece of art and really like it, and someone buys it and then it's gone. So by creating art where the value is actually in the digital version, each painting printed out just becomes one version of that artwork. Each painting is saved as a vector file, printed on canvas and stretched locally. This sort of technique has existed forever but it's a different way of thinking about it, that the real painting is the digital version of it.</p>
